### Project Overview
This project aims to enhance the reliability and performance of SSD firmware by automating comprehensive testing and implementing predictive maintenance. The key problem addressed is the risk of SSD failures and the inefficiencies in current testing methodologies. Our approach integrates automated testing processes into the firmware development lifecycle and analyzes operational logs to forecast potential hardware failures. The impact of our solution includes improved SSD reliability, reduced downtime, and enhanced operational efficiency in data centers.

- **Problem Statement**: The project addresses the challenge of SSD firmware testing and the need for proactive maintenance to prevent hardware failures, leading to system downtime and reduced performance.
- **Proposed Solution**: Our AI-powered solution automates firmware testing while providing recommendations for code optimization. It gathers and analyzes operational logs to predict potential SSD failures and schedules necessary maintenance, ensuring enhanced reliability and performance in storage systems.
